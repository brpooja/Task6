#  Online Sales Analysis Using SQL

This project analyzes an `online_sales` dataset using SQL to understand **monthly revenue** and **order volume trends** over time.

---

##  Table: `online_sales`

| Column       | Type      | Description               |
| ------------ | --------- | ------------------------- |
| `order_id`   | `INT`     | Unique order identifier   |
| `product_id` | `INT`     | ID of the product sold    |
| `order_date` | `DATE`    | Date of the order         |
| `amount`     | `DECIMAL` | Total amount of the order |

---

## Sample Data

The dataset contains 10 entries covering orders from **January to April 2024**.

```sql
INSERT INTO online_sales VALUES
(1, 101, '2024-01-15', 500.00),
(2, 102, '2024-01-20', 700.00),
-- ...
(10, 105, '2024-04-25', 850.00);
```

## Key Queries

### ðŸ”¹ Monthly Revenue & Order Volume

```sql
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS month,
    SUM(amount) AS total_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders
FROM 
    online_sales
GROUP BY 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date),
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date)
ORDER BY 
    year, month;
```

 This query helps track performance over **each month**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Filtered Analysis (Janâ€“Mar 2024)

```sql
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS month,
    SUM(amount) AS total_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders
FROM 
    online_sales
WHERE 
    order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-03-31'
GROUP BY 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date),
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date)
ORDER BY 
    year, month;
```

 This query focuses on **Q1 performance** only.
